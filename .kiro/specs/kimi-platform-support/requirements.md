# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds support for Kimi AI (kimi.ai) platform to the existing AI Chat History Extractor browser extension. Kimi is a popular AI assistant platform that allows users to have conversations with AI models. Users should be able to extract their conversation history from Kimi in the same formats (Markdown, HTML, Plain Text) as currently supported for ChatGPT, Claude, and Poe platforms.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user of Kimi AI platform, I want to extract my conversation history from kimi.ai, so that I can save and archive my important AI conversations locally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the browser extension popup on kimi.ai THEN the system SHALL detect the platform as "kimi"
2. WHEN the user clicks "Extract Conversation" on kimi.ai THEN the system SHALL parse the DOM to extract all conversation messages
3. WHEN conversation extraction is successful THEN the system SHALL identify both user messages and AI responses correctly
4. WHEN conversation extraction is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain the chronological order of messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Kimi platform to support all existing export formats, so that I can choose the format that best suits my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extracting from Kimi THEN the system SHALL support Markdown format export
2. WHEN extracting from Kimi THEN the system SHALL support HTML format export
3. WHEN extracting from Kimi THEN the system SHALL support Plain Text format export
4. WHEN user selects any format THEN the system SHALL generate a downloadable file with appropriate extension (.md, .html, .txt)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Kimi extraction to handle the platform's specific DOM structure, so that all conversation content is captured accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parsing Kimi conversations THEN the system SHALL identify user message containers correctly
2. WHEN parsing Kimi conversations THEN the system SHALL identify AI response containers correctly
3. WHEN parsing Kimi conversations THEN the system SHALL extract message timestamps if available
4. WHEN parsing Kimi conversations THEN the system SHALL handle code blocks, formatting, and special content properly
5. IF a conversation contains images or attachments THEN the system SHALL include appropriate placeholders or references

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the extension to provide clear feedback during Kimi extraction, so that I understand the process status and can troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extraction starts on Kimi THEN the system SHALL display "Platform detected: kimi" in debug log
2. WHEN extraction completes THEN the system SHALL show the number of messages extracted
3. IF extraction fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message explaining the issue
4. WHEN no conversation is found THEN the system SHALL inform the user that no extractable content was detected

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Kimi platform integration to follow the same patterns as existing platforms, so that the user experience is consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension detects kimi.ai domain THEN the system SHALL enable the extension icon in the browser toolbar
2. WHEN background script processes Kimi messages THEN the system SHALL use the same message routing patterns as other platforms
3. WHEN Kimi extraction is triggered THEN the system SHALL follow the same async/await patterns as existing platforms
4. WHEN file download is initiated THEN the system SHALL use the same download mechanism as other platforms

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Kimi implementation to be maintainable and extensible, so that future updates and bug fixes are straightforward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing Kimi support THEN the system SHALL create a separate kimi.ts module in the llm/ directory
2. WHEN adding Kimi platform detection THEN the system SHALL update the platform.ts module with Kimi detection logic
3. WHEN updating background script THEN the system SHALL add kimi.ai to the supported domains list
4. WHEN implementing DOM parsing THEN the system SHALL use TypeScript with proper type annotations
5. WHEN adding Kimi support THEN the system SHALL follow the existing error handling patterns
